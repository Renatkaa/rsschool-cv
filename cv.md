## About me
I am creative and sociable. I do photography in my spare time, I know how to use Photoshop. I am always energetic when it comes to work so I am ready to learn new skills and absorb new information quickly.


The main reason i am apllying for the position of Junior Frond-end Developer is that this job will satisfy my need for creativity. The front end is the part where you see the result of your work, it is connected with visual aspects. I am a visualizer so this position suits me best.  I am certain that being a part of your company would be an exceptional opportunity for me to grow both professionally and personally.


As i have mentioned before, i have no experience in programming. But i am eager to absorb the information and produce quality work.


I do understand that it is risky to choose a person without any experience. I can only promise you to do my best so that both of us benefit from our collaboration.
